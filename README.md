# Rotating Navigation

Creating a nav bar that when accessed, will rotate the page out of the way to reveal a nav bar. 

Practicing with the CSS properties ***transition*** and ***transform***. Only needed JavaScript for the ***event listener***. 

The links do not work because this project was only for practice.
